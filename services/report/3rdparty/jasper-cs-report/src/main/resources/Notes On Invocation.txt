As an example of invoking the acq_basic report from, e.g., poster, here is a payload that shows how to use parameters. The report has a parameter called "queryYear" that when invoked in the no-context mode, will restrict the acquisitions to that year. See the actual report for how the query is built. 

The invocation payload is:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
<ns2:invocationContext
xmlns:ns2="http://collectionspace.org/services/common/invocable">
  <mode>nocontext</mode>
  <docType>Acquisition</docType>
  <params>
    <param>
      <key>queryYear</key>
      <value>2000</value>
    </param>
  </params>
</ns2:invocationContext>

Note that this can be used for a report with any output type - it only impacts the invocation properties.
